# ...just sports...

Lot of people would like to doo some sports and don't want to get caught up in boring routine of training or repeating always the same exercises, going to same places, doing all the same stuff ower and ower again.

Our goal is to connect people from one community to meet up and train/play all kinds of sports together. We play a variety of sports in diferent locations making it so interesting to come and have fun with people with the same goal.

Users of the website will be able to see our location and times wann we meetup, registering to our page user will get information on our next meetups or some tournaments wich they could join.

I tested this page in different browsers Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

I confirmed that this project looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

I confirmed that the navigation, header, locations, sign up, section and footer are all readable and easy to understand.

I confirmed that the form works: requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works.
